# About Me

Hi,

I am Natalya!

I am a dedicated designer who is inspired by the following things, such as the apparel design, sewing, pattern making and art drawing. Over ten years of experience in the fashion apparel design industry, I am thrilled about making the unique clothing pieces that will be making people a bit happier, catching their eyes and feeling them laugh every day.

I believe that design is the emotional expression or application of human creative skills and imagination like used usually in the visual art objects. Clothing design works are bringing the value and attractiveness to people primarily by their simplicity, beauty and emotional power.

Design is my personal outlet of creativity that brings me joy of seeing my customers empowered by my clothing works.
